# Introduction
  * This dataset includes the names and characterics of olympic athletes from 1896-2016. Variables include personal statistics, (such as age, gender, height, and weight of each athlete), along with the sport, country, and medals received. There is another dataset that provides the National Olympic Committee code (NOC) and the corresponding geographical region. Source information about the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home

# Data Exploration

# Summarize Gender:
olympics %>% group_by(region, Sex) %>% count()

# Summarize Age:

###  Investigate two-way relationships 
  
# Scatterplots for two numeric variables: numeric vs numeric

    # Athlete Height vs Weight 
olympics %>% ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) + geom_jitter(colour = "navy", size = 0.5)

    # Athlete Age vs Height 
olympics %>% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Height)) + geom_jitter(colour = "red", size = 0.1)

    # Athlete Avg vs Weight
olympics %>% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Weight)) + geom_jitter(colour = "red", size = 0.1)

# Side-by-side boxplots or facetted polots for numeric/categorical pair: numeric vs. categorical 

    # Female vs Male athletes by year for summer olympics 
olympics %>% filter(Season == "Summer") %>%  group_by(Year, Sex) %>% count() %>% ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n, colour = Sex)) + geom_point() + geom_line()

    # Female vs Male athletes by year for winter olympics
olympics %>% filter(Season == "Winter") %>%  group_by(Year, Sex) %>% count() %>% ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = n, colour = Sex)) + geom_point() + geom_line()

    # Age vs number of medals 
medals = olympics %>% filter(Medal == c("Gold", "Silver", "Bronze"))
medals_age = medals %>% group_by(Age, Medal) %>% count() %>% mutate(Num_Medals = n) %>% select(-n)

medals_age %>% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Num_Medals, colour = Medal)) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values=c("#bf6f40", "#ffbf00", "#bab2ab"))
medals_age %>% ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Num_Medals, fill = Medal)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#bf6f40", "#ffbf00", "#bab2ab"))

    # Number of medals per country
medals_country = medals %>% group_by(region, Medal) %>% count() %>% mutate(Num_Medals = n) %>% select(-n) %>% arrange(desc(Num_Medals), Medal)

medals_country %>%  filter(region %in% c("USA", "Russia", "Germany", "UK", "France")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = region, y = Num_Medals, fill = Medal)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + coord_flip() + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#bf6f40", "#ffbf00", "#bab2ab"))
